      <description>Passion is an interesting concept. Everyone has a different thing or person or act that defines passion for them. In the end, though, it pretty much means the same thing: it&amp;rsquo;s what drives you. Personally. Emotionally. Maybe financially, if you&amp;rsquo;re that sort. It&amp;rsquo;s what excites you, maybe gives you a sense of purpose, or a goal to work toward. Wakes you up. Gets your attention. But does it define you?</description>
