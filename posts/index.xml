      <title>5th Piece: A method of protecting AWS EC2 from accessing AWS meta-data URI</title>

      <description>Lots of folks working with AWS EC2 know about utilizing the back-end metadata URL (http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/) for retrieving instance information. Some of the information you get from this link is pretty innocuous: availability zone, AMI. Some is pretty revealing: IP address and &amp;ndash; most damaging in the wrong hands &amp;ndash; instance IAM credentials.
Yes, if your instance has an IAM Role attached to it, its credentials &amp;ndash; although technically temporary/rotating &amp;ndash; are retrieved through this metadata URI.</description>

      <title>4th Piece: Preventing Docker logouts with concurrent Jenkins builds</title>

      <description>We were running into an issue with our Docker image builds when running them concurrently on the same Jenkins node. In order to pull or push images from/to the repository, Jenkins first needs to authenticate. By default, Docker will store the credentials for the session in the Jenkins user&amp;rsquo;s $HOME/.docker directory, in the config.json file. But this means any other builds on that node &amp;ndash; or potentially any user with access to the Jenkins $HOME &amp;ndash; can see and use those credentials themselves.</description>

      <title>3rd Piece: The Cloud-Agnostic Argument</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve already been running your production environment in the cloud for, say, the past five-plus years or so, you&amp;rsquo;re probably feeling pretty happy right where you are &amp;ndash; or, at least, pretty comfortable. And let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;ve migrated your non-cloud app and its infrastructure over to this cloud provider, as-is: simple VMs, maybe a load balancer. Then, over the years, you&amp;rsquo;ve matured this environment to take advantage of what this cloud provider has to offer: object storage, caching, auto-scaling, managed databases.</description>

      <title>2nd Piece: Misunderstandings and Misfortunes of AWS ELBs</title>

      <description>Well, this is embarrassing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with AWS for many years now, but I will likely never claim that I know everything about any particular service and, most especially, every service offering that&amp;rsquo;s available. The velocity of change there and, really, with any modern cloud provider is dizzying, and keeping up with it can be tough. But, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t excuse my not fully understanding the basic features of a fundamental piece of infrastructure there.</description>

      <description>Passion is an interesting concept. Everyone has a different thing or person or act that defines passion for them. In the end, though, it pretty much means the same thing: it&amp;rsquo;s what drives you. Personally. Emotionally. Maybe financially, if you&amp;rsquo;re that sort. It&amp;rsquo;s what excites you, maybe gives you a sense of purpose, or a goal to work toward. Wakes you up. Gets your attention. But does it define you?</description>
